# Features
With the new site, a lot of effort is going into remedying the shortcomings of the current website.  
For archive "features", check out the Archive Improvements document.

## Officially Supported Themes
* HTML 2.0 [Text Theme]
* HTML 3.2 [**Default Theme**]
* XHTML 1.0 [Theme ported from macintoshgarden]
* HTML 5.0 [Mobile]
* HTML 5.0 [Modern]

Each theme has different features, though the core experience remains the same.

## What the above means
The default theme offer a much lighter and faster browsing experience than ever before, miniscule amount traces of vanilla JS can be found which has zero impact on performance.

## Site Settings
Anonymous users and registered alike have access to the site settings via the menu, which offers the possibility of changing how the site look, feels and behaves!  

For registered users, this will mean that your settings will persist after logging in and applying the different settings, next time you log back on the settings are applied instantly.

## Control through subdomains
Graphics ain't your cup of tea? Apply the text subdomain and bypass the default theme / previous settings.
