## Site Settings
Anonymous users and registered alike have access to the site settings via the menu, which offers the possibility of changing how the site look, feels and behaves!  
For registered users, this will mean that your settings will persist after logging in and applying the settings, next time you log back on the settings are applied instantly.

## What the above means
The default theme offer a much lighter and faster browsing experience than ever before, miniscule amount traces of vanilla JS can be found which has zero impact on performance.

## Control through subdomains
Graphics ain't your cup of tea? Apply the text subdomain and bypass the default theme / previous settings.
