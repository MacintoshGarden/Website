# Image Hosting
A very basic and simple image hosting service, available to vintage and modern browsers alike.

## Description
The service allows images up to 3 MB in size to be uploaded - keep in mind that we do not manipulate images, therefore metadata is *not* scrubbed.

It is intended mainly for hosting images in relation to Macintosh Garden, but not limited to this space.  
Anyone can use the service - free from ads, time constraints, registration, tracking, manipulation.

## Supported Image Formats
The service currently handles the following basic formats; GIF, JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP

There is also support for images (MacPaint) / screenshots taken from System 6 and System 7, however a file extension has to be appended to the filename prior to uploading the image(s).

**MacPaint Images / System 6 Screenshots**  
Append the .mac or .paint extension to the filename.

**PICT Images / System 7 Screenshots**  
Append either .pct or .pict to the filename.

## Bugs
There are some known minor bugs related to PICT files.
