# Image Hosting
A very basic and simple image hosting service, available to vintage and modern browsers alike.

## Description
The service allows images up to 4 MB in size to be uploaded - keep in mind that we do not manipulate images, therefore metadata is *not* scrubbed.

It is intended mainly for hosting images in relation to Macintosh Garden, but not limited to this space.  
Anyone can use the service - free from ads, time constraints, registration, tracking, manipulation.

## Supported Image Formats
The service currently handles the following basic formats; GIF, JPG/JPEG, PICT, PNG/APNG, WebP

**Note that** the service will not accept image files without a proper file extension attached.

## Bugs / Issues
There are minor known issues with PICT images, though generally works 99% of the time.

## News
Version 2.0.0 officially released on May 20th, 2023.  
This is a complete rewrite of the entire image hosting service, improving stability and performance.
