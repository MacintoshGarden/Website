# Branches
Instead of throwing all the contents into one basket (hey, less clutter and confusion!), some of the things you could find on the old site has been axed and moved to another branch within the Garden.

While this may seem confusing, it should hopefully seem less so if and when one gets a better feel for how it works.

## Branches
* [Image Hosting](Image-Hosting.md), exactly what it says on the tin.
* [Public Proxy](Public-Proxy.md), A simple public proxy made for vintage computers in mind.
* [Web Hosting](Web-Hosting.md), for those that wish to experience the 90's, before online editors and their offspring became a thing.
