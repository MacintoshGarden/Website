# Archive Access
We offer various means of access to the archive, which always has been and always will be free.

## WWW
While I would love to put all of the contents on the website, I really don't think it's possible without creating a confusing mess.  
The website is mainly for presenting information on titles and serving up images, documents and the essential files. When there are more things available that is not presented on a title page, the page will state that there are more items available inside the archive.

## FTP
One of the ways to access the archive. Requires a username and password.  
**Note** that the Incoming folder is reserved for file uploads, and while listing the contents is permitted - downloading is not.

**Accessing the FTP**  
All the connection information is available via the website.

**Incoming Directory Explained**  
Due to the nature of the archive, file uploads can be done by both registered and anonymous users.  
To protect ourselves as well as any user from malicious files, the contents of the Incoming folder needs to be processed by the system before it is moved to the appropriate area.

## Hotline
Another way to access the archive. Guest access is enabled.

**Accessing the Hotline Server**  
The Hotline server is currently offline.

**File Size Limitations**  
Note that attempting to download files larger than xGB will cause some issues, this is a limitation with Hotline.
