# Discussion Board - Markdown
Traditionally, discussion boards / forums give users access to a set of BBCode to customise the contents of whatever they may be posting... though we've gone down a different path and chosen Markdown to be the way to customise post contents.

While we do not yet support the full Markdown experience, at least right now, the most important features are available.
