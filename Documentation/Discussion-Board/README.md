# Discussion Board
This one has been built from the ground up, is not yet fully complete and may contain bugs.. but it also seems to work.

For the various features, a document should be available - see the list below.

## Features
* **Basic**
  * Create threads
  * Reply to posts
  * Edit / update posts
* **New**
  * Mentioning users
  * Subscribing to threads
  * Markdown instead of BBCode / HTML
  * Flat list instead of threaded list
  * Automatic local storing and caching of external images
  * Post ranks
  * Discussion Board ranks
  * Forum user profiles, seperate from the main user profiles
  * Special categories (ties in with DB Ranks)
  * New / updated threads and posts read/unread status scaling much better

## Special Categories
There are two categories which are different from the rest (at this point in time).

**Special Category 1 & 2**  
Under 'The Archive' sits three categories, Applications, Games and Serials. Out of these three, two are slightly special... Applications and Games are limited in a fashion where new threads can not be posted by users (staff included), instead they are generated automatically by the system.

However, the system generated threads in these two categories can be replied to.  
This is mainly to keep the duplicate threads down to a minimum, and causes less confusion when trying to find topics on certain titles that previously could be discussed in different threads with similar names. Also ties in as comments for pages.

**Special Category 3**  
The third (*currently unavailable*) category is the trading post, where trading, selling and buying is allowed, creating posts under this category will require the user account to receive a trader flag and also opens up for positive / negative feedback options for when deals are made.

With enough negative feedback, the user has the trader permission revoked automatically and permanently.  
There are algorithms in place to prevent erronous permission revokals.
