# JavaScript
Even though generally considered bad because people on the internet said so, there is plenty of utility with near-zero impact on performance if used correctly.

## Text Theme - JS  
Zero JS, none at all.

## Default Theme - JS  
Basic functions that deals with browser history (going back to the previous page) and opening windows, will however be removed and available via settings instead. It may have some impact on the user experience but for some reason the hate is strong when it comes to JS.

**JS Settings Toggle**  
There will be three settings available via the site settings, by default JS is toggled off - meaning you won't see any of it.

The second option is called 'Basic', which will enable the basic JS across the default theme, this is reliant of the browser being able to deal with JavaScript 1.0 and just does basic browser stuff on the client side, such as back / forward buttons, opening new windows and the likes.

Third option being 'Advanced', it enables the full experience without much negative impact on performance, however it raises the bar on the required browser since there is DOM manipulation involved. Examples of supported browsers are iCab 2.99, Netscape 4.x, Internet Explorer 4.x or newer.

## Garden 2009 Theme
With HTML 4.01, there will be JS and it will not be possible to toggle on or off.  
When using this theme, it is already expected that a more modern browser is used. Disabling JS in the browser will most likely cripple the user experience.

## Modern / Mobile Theme
Same as above.
