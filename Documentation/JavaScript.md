# JavaScript
This is something that I would like to use as little as possible when it comes to the default theme, though there are traces here and there. However, it's the kind that has zero impact on performance.

## Text Theme - JS  
Zero JS, none at all.

## Default Theme - JS  
Basic functions that deals with browser history (going back to the previous page) and opening windows, will however be removed and available via settings instead. It may have some impact on the user experience but for some reason the hate is strong when it comes to JS.

**JS Settings Toggle**  
The bar is set a bit higher when it comes to enabling JS via the site settings, the minimum requirements will be iCab 2.99, Netscape 4.x, Internet Explorer 4.x or newer due to some functions that deal with the DOM.

**What's Available**  
* Browser History (moving back / forward)
* Form validation, client-side
* Various DOM functions

## Garden 2009
With HTML 4.01, there will be JS and it will not be possible to toggle on or off.  
When using this theme, it is already expected that a more modern browser is used. Disabling JS in the browser will most likely cripple the user experience.

## Modern / Mobile
Same as above.
