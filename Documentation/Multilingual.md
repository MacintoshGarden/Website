# Multilingual
The website is able to display most of the text found in multiple different languages, provided that a translation is available.

## Changing the Language
Via the Site Settings, available to both registered and guests, the language can be changed from the language dropdown list.  
Changes are applied (at least should be) instantly.

## Additional Information
The base language is English, and it's machine translated into other languages.  
This impacts the performance a bit if the translation is not cached, though once cached it should be just as performant as the text in English when rendering pages.

As machine translation is used, there may and will be some inaccurate translations - however, this should only be minor.
