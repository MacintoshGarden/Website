# Multilingual
The website is able to display most of the text found in multiple different languages, provided that a translation is available.

## Changing the Language
Via the Site Settings, available to both registered and guests, the language can be changed from the language dropdown list.  
Changes are applied (at least should be) instantly.

## Additional Translations
Translations are community efforts and derived from the English language file, tailored to fit the website. If a native language is missing from the list of available languages and feel up to the task, a translation is more than welcome.
