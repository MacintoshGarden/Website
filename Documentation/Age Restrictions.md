# Website Content, Age Restrictions
A family friendly approach to the content available on the website, by default anything with excessive violence, blood / gore, substance abuse, nudity etc. falls under certain categories and is either limited or simply not shown at all.

## Mature, 17+
Most of the titles are available, however the screenshots are censored and the files are not available. Other data may also be censored.

## Adult
These titles simply do not show up at all.  
Requires the Mature setting to be toggled first, and is unavailable until then.

## How to access age restricted content
The availability of the above can be changed via the Site Settings, and is a conscious action - you have only yourself to blame if you see something you don't like if either is toggled, and have no right to complain.
