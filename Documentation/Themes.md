# Website Themes - Look & Feel
The look, feel and functionality of the website can be altered via the Site Settings link, an account is not required to play around with the settings, though with an account the settings are tied to you and applied when logging in (and cleared when logging out).

Sessions are not persistent, they are maintained by the system and will expire for security reasons.

## Classic [HTML 3.2] [default]
A good middle ground for nearly anything old, and somewhat new... users with 8k+ gigawide monitors and supercomputers from the future may want to switch to either [Garden 2009] or [Modern] for a better experience, lest magnifying goggles are ready and available.

## Garden 2009 [HTML 4.01+]
For those unwilling to take the leap and accept change, this theme has been ported over from macintoshgarden.org and looks roughly the same, but benefits from the new system. Many new / changed elements.

## Mobile [HTML 5] [mobile / tablet default]
This theme is in still in the early stages, but will present a basic yet functional experience for hunting applications and games on a mobile device.

## Modern [HTML 5]
Bells, whistles and the kitchen sink... The generic bloat of our time.

## Text [HTML 2.0] [default for text-based browsers]
There are no graphical elements, everything is presented in glorious text.
