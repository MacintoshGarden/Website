# Discussion Board
This one has been built from the ground up, is not yet fully complete and may contain bugs.. but it also seems to work.

For the various features, a document should be available - see the list below.

## Features
* **Basic**
  * Create threads
  * Reply to posts
  * Edit / update posts
* **New**
  * Mentioning users
  * Subscribing to threads
  * Markdown instead of BBCode / HTML
  * Flat design instead of threaded list
  * Automatic local storing and caching of external images
  * Post ranks

## Special Categories
There are two categories which are different from the rest (at this point in time).

Under 'The Archive' sits three categories, Applications, Games and Serials. Out of these three, two are slightly special... Applications and Games are limited in a fashion where new threads can not be posted by users, instead they are generated automatically by the system.

However, the system generated threads in these two categories can be replied to.  
This is mainly to keep the duplicate threads down to a minimum, and causes less confusion when trying to find topics on certain titles that previously could be discussed in different threads with similar names.
