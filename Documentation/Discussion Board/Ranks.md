# Discussion Board - Ranks
Ranks are split into two categories and differ slightly from one another.

## Post Ranks
This is basically just for fun, it 'levels up' and shows a rank depending on the amount of posts a user has made, and is visible under the avatar.

There are plenty of different ranks to go around, some are default, others hidden and shows up when reaching certain milestones.

## Discussion Board Rank
Counts as the rank a user holds on the discussion board, for instance a 'Trader' which has access to post within the trading board.  
Some of these special ranks carries a certain level of responsibility.
