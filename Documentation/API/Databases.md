# Databases
There have been some changes and additions made to the API, which opens a few more doors, and that is the availability of additional parts of the database.

The root API endpoint should be able to tell which additional endpoints are available.

## Archive
The archive is essentially split into multiple categories depending on the data and how it is compiled and presented.  
With the archive endpoint, a user can find out which additional endpoints are available, below are simple examples of what is available here.

**Applications**  
As guessed, applications found inside the archive.

**Games**  
Just as above, probably contains the most data out of the available categories.

**Misc**  
There are of course additional parts available, such as operating systems, drivers, extensions, desk accessories and the likes.

## Serials
The serials database is as simple as it gets, and it is possible to fetch it in its entirety via the API, or by searching.  
Only regulated, verified and working data is available inside this database.

## Type / Creator
This particular database is fairly niche.  
Just as serials, the type / creator database is simple in its design, and contains data on file extensions, file type and creator data - and can be fetched as a whole or be searched.
