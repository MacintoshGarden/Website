# API
Yes, this thing has been asked for before by a handful of people, I do however see that it can be useful for a lot of different thing (especially developers).

Each member signed up at the Garden gets a key assigned automatically, though a developer key requires the user to request a new key.  
Requesting a developer key isn't really that hard, fill in one form field and hit submit - wait for a response.

## Access Levels
**Public / Guest**  
Strict & limited API operations.

**Regular**  
Basic API operations.

**Developer**  
Basic API operations.  
Unlimited calls per day.

## Limitations
There are some limitations when it comes to the **public / guest** as well as **regular** API access levels that are important to note.

**Public / Guest**  
This is rate limited and regulated in terms of how much information can be searched and fetched.
