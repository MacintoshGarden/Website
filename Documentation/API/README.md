# API
Yes, this thing has been asked for before by a handful of people, I do however see that it can be useful for a lot of different thing (especially developers).

Each member signed up at the Garden gets a key assigned automatically, though a developer key requires the user to request a new key.  
Requesting a developer key isn't really that hard, fill in one form field and hit submit - wait for a response.
