# Website - Subscriptions & Notifications
By default, any and all E-Mail notifications are disabled for freshly registered users, and will stay disabled until they are actively enabled by the user.

Notification settings are available in the User Panel when logged in, and is pretty straightforward.

A handy subscription manager is also available that will list current subscriptions.  
Links are presented where applicable, and the option to remove subscriptions is also available.

## Discussion Board Mentions
Users can mention one another by @username, though there are no notifications sent out. An event is however logged on the user panel regardless.  
An indicator on the website will be serve as a notification on mentions.

## Discussion Board Threads
Users can subscribe to active threads and receive notification both as an indicator on the website as well as via E-Mail whenever a response is made to the subscribed thread.

## Private Messages
Notification are available for private messages, though no notifications are sent out, an indicator for new unread messages pops up on the user panel regardless.

## Guestbook Entries
It's possible to be notified if someone enters something into your guestbook, though nothing is delivered until enabled... an event is logged on the user panel regardless.

## Bookmarked Software
It's entirely possible to receive a notification when a page is updated, how fancy is that?  
Notifications for software entries are somewhat limited, to prevent excessive, unnecessary and perhaps abusive use.
