# User Profiles
Each registered user has a personal profile which can be toggled to be either public, private or friends-only... a personal space of sorts with direct access to a variety of other related items, such as the guestbook and more.

## Styling Options
Users have some control over their profile, such as the ability to show / hide the avatar as well as write some text about themselves, who they are and what they do... or something else entirely.

The profile block itself uses Markdown, and does therefore allow styling to a certain extent.
