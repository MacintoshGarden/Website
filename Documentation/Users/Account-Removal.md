# Account Removal
Accounts are never deleted, however if decided that an account wasn't necessary, a user can opt out at any time and have their data scrubbed from the database.

## What happens with ...
**Username**  
Re-generated and taken randomly from a list.

**Display Name**  
See above.

**Avatar**  
Randomly re-generated.

**Password**  
Garbled upp into randomness and encrypted.

**E-Mail**  
Nulled.

**Notepad**  
Any and all notes are nulled and sent to the void.

**Friends List**  
Nulled, removed from all parties without notice.

**Private Messages**  
Nulled. Any messages received and saved by other users from the removed account will remain, however it will only display the new random username for them.

**Guestbook Entries**  
Retained, however the user/display names change.

**Forum Posts**  
Retained, however the user/display names change.

## Automatic Process
Once the request has been made, it can not be undone.  
Fake and random data will be instantly generated, encrypted and overwrite the old data, the account will be flagged and permanently disabled without the possibility to be re-instated.
